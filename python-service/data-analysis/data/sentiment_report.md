## Representative quotes by question

### Experience

Positive:
- (n7oh8onc) It was good! It definitely was better than just plain practice. I liked the highlighted regions where it detected potential inconsistencies.
- (ndrqs3sg) I think that the feedback is useful for engagement and increase the desire of improvement. It could be useful, at some point that you have the graphics and try to adjust to them in real time.
Negative:
- (chxrj0wq) The feedback tool was not in real-time so I could not make immediate corrections. It was not very easy to adjust my pitch after the analysis tool. The feedback tool was useful in understanding where I was correct and whe…
- (y6v3g63s) The tool looks great but seems to have some problem with alignments between what I sang and what was supposed to be sang.
### Improvement

Positive:
- (y6v3g63s) For sure!
- (b068bafw) Yes, i focused more on nuances, the hardest one was tempo because i didnt know if i was rushing or not
Negative:
- (oplv7i5e) Not really because for me auditory cues are more helpful than visual cues
- (3d1ly0bg) It's hard to say, I hope there's a control group that is just practicing and listening to their own audio, because I feel like the practice inherently helps
### Highlights

Positive:
- (w4m19emj) Yes they were helpful for showing me where I need to focus.
- (xzdbn2c2) Yes definitely. The pitch curve and dynamics curve were quite good choices for the plot.
Negative:
- (3tzisfce) They were, but sometimes I wouldn't see any highlighted area even though I still considered the performance not perfect at all.
- (3d1ly0bg) yeah they were
### Payment

Positive:
- (etuygx3k) If I were recording music I would definitely pay for it because I think it is very useful for improving but at the moment I don’t have a need for it
- (ndrqs3sg) If my work implied singing, yes, but I would compare it first to other similar tools if exists. If singing is a hobby I would not pay for it.
Negative:
- (w4m19emj) I would pay a maximum of 5$ a month.
- (oplv7i5e) No

## Interpretation

- Experience: comments often mention clarity, engagement, and desire for real-time feedback; some misalignment issues noted.
- Improvement: many report the tool helps focus on problem areas; a few feel practice alone drives gains or visual cues are less helpful than listening.
- Highlights: helpful for pitch/dynamics for several participants; occasional irrelevance due to silences or phrasing changes.
- Payment: willingness varies; some would pay a small subscription or one-time fee, others say no without real-time features or proven efficacy.

## Additional analysis

### Word clouds (combined)

A 2x2 figure with distinct color palettes for each question was generated in the notebook output.

### Stronger sentiment (VADER)

VADER could not be installed in this environment; the analysis falls back to the lexicon approach for comparability.

### Correlations with numeric fields
